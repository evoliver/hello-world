# hello-world

My first repo as I learn about github! 

Lovely meeting you! I am Elaine. Sometimes called Lainey. I am very slowly learning to code and use Github correctly. The goal is to learn enough to help developers and not make them try to explain their craft. I hope to use this knowledge to help translate their needs to others. We'll see how that goes. In the meantime, I'm living the life in Portland, OR and attempting to get back into print making.
